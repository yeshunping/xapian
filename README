Welcome to the Xapian repository!
=================================

Xapian is split into several modules, which are held in sub-directories of
the directory containing this file.  The core code and documentation is in
the xapian-core module.

If you're new to hacking on Xapian, you should probably start by reading the
xapian-core/HACKING file.  If you're new to Xapian entirely, you should
probably read the xapian-core/README file, or you can find further information
on our website at http://xapian.org/

本项目目前只是xapian的一份拷贝，后续计划基于xapian ,将其编译方式修改为blade, 
同时基于xapian进行后续开发，开发一个更为通用的搜索引擎。
